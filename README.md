# stella-realtime-sentiment-tool

# Introduction
Stella is an app that connects to Twitter's API for the purpose of reading tweets in realtime that contains keywords specified by the user and analyze tweets for their sentiment. It relies on the TextBlob library[TextBlob library](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)  for sentiment analysis. 
Some possible applications for this include:
* Calculating the social sentiment of particular political figures or issues
* Calculating sentiment scores for brands
* Using sentiment scores as training features for a learning algorithm to determine stock buy and sell triggers
* And more!
